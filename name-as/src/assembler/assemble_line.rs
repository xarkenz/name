/*

I can understand that this assemble function may at first seem to be kind of a behemoth. This is because you are right and it is.

The logic is as follows:
- Break each line into its components and specify by type what needs to happen for each component
- If an instruction was present, retrieve its information from the constant table
- If registers/immediates/identifiers are provided, push them to an arguments vector
- If symbols are encountered, there are two cases. In the case that the symbols are defined, create a relocation entry with
    the appropriate index into the symbol table; else, if the symbol represents a forward or global reference, create a
    new symbol with the placeholder value, and create the relocation entry by referencing that symbol.
- After all this is said and done, call the assemble_instruction helper with the arguments and symbol table if an instruction was present
- Instead, if a directive was present, call the appropriate handler.
- Update tracking variables (line_number, current_address, etc.) appropriately
